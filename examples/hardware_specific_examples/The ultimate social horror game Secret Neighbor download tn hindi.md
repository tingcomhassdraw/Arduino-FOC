- Explore the house carefully and look for keys in drawers, cabinets, boxes, and other places. You can also find useful items such as flashlights, bear traps, fireworks, and weapons.
- Communicate with your teammates using voice chat or text chat. You can also ping locations or items by pressing F. Share your keys with your teammates if they need them, or ask them for keys if you have none.
- Be careful of the Neighbor in disguise. He can look like any of the Kids and act friendly, but he can also transform into his true form and attack you. You can tell if someone is the Neighbor by looking for clues such as suspicious behavior, glowing eyes, or missing items.
- If you encounter the Neighbor, you can fight back by using your items or abilities. You can also run away and hide in closets, under beds, or behind objects. You can also revive your teammates if they are knocked out by the Neighbor.
- If you manage to find all six keys and unlock the basement door, you win the game. However, you still need to enter the basement and escape through the exit door. The Neighbor can still chase you in the basement, so be quick and careful.

### Playing as a Neighbor
 
If you are playing as a Neighbor, your goal is to stop the Kids from entering the basement by any means necessary. You can disguise yourself as any of the Kids and use your abilities and gadgets to deceive, trap, and catch them. You can also transform into your true form and use your strength and speed to overpower them.
 
As a Neighbor, you should be aware of the following tips and tricks:

- Use your disguise wisely and blend in with the Kids. You can act friendly and helpful, but also try to sabotage their efforts by stealing their keys or items, lying about their locations, or setting up traps for them.
- Use your abilities and gadgets to your advantage. You can choose from different classes of Neighbors, each with their own skills and tools. For example, you can use the Leader's hunting trap to immobilize a Kid, or use the Scout's camouflage to sneak up on them.
- Transform into your true form when you have a chance to catch a Kid. You can do this by pressing T or by using certain abilities. You can also transform back into a Kid by pressing T again or by hiding in a closet.
- If you catch a Kid, you can either knock them out or carry them away. Knocking them out will make them drop their keys and items, but they can be revived by their teammates. Carrying them away will make them disappear from the game for a while, but they can escape from your grip by struggling.
- If you manage to catch all the Kids or survive until the time runs out, you win the game. However, you should be careful of the Kids' items or abilities that can hurt you or reveal your identity.

Secret Neighbor is a fun and exciting game that tests your skills of deception, cooperation, and survival. Whether you play as a Kid or a Neighbor, you will need to use your wits and resources to achieve your goal. We hope this article has helped you learn how to play Secret Neighbor better.
